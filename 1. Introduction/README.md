## 1. Compiled Languages and C++
### 1.1 Why Use a Language Like C++?

At its core, a computer is just a processor with some memory, capable of running tiny instructions like “store 5 in memory location 23459.” Why would we express a program as a text file in a programming language, instead of writing processor instructions?

The advantages:

1. <b>Conciseness:</b> programming languages allow us to express common sequences of commands more concisely. C++ provides some especially powerful shorthands.

2. <b>Maintainability:</b> modifying codeis easier whenit entailsjust afew text edits,instead of rearranging hundreds of processor instructions. C++ is object oriented (more on that in Lectures 7-8), which further improves maintainability.

3. <b>Portability:</b> differentprocessors makedifferentinstructions available. Programs written as text can be translated into instructions for many different processors; one of
